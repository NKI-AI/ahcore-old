Ahcore are the [AI for Oncology](https://aiforoncology.nl) core components for computational pathology.
It provides a set of tools for working with pathology images and annotations.
It also offers standard computational pathology algorithms.

Check the [full documentation](https://docs.aiforoncology.nl/ahcore) for more details on how to use ahcore.
